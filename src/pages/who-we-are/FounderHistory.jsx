            - Dr. Light Amedzekor
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          <strong>Dr. Light Amedzekor</strong> was born in the United States on
          March 9th, 1987 and received all his education from USA before moving
          to Ghana to help impoverished people. Light became a visionary and a
          social entrepreneur at a young age after watching his mother Victoria
          suffer from serious eye conditions. She later lost her sight in Ghana
          due to lack of accessibility of eye care at that time.
        </p>

        <p>
          At an early age, Dr. Amedzekor developed an altruistic love of helping
          others and was devoted to his education because he knew where he came
          from and remembered how impoverished his family was, as education in
          Ghana was not free. At college, he was the first African-American
          student government president, who committed to change how things were
          running at school and also served as the editor-in-chief of the school
          newspaper.
        </p>

            The Turning Point
          </h3>
          <p className="text-yellow-800">
            On January 1st 2012, Dr. Light followed his passion and founded{" "}
            <strong>Eye Can See Now Initiative</strong> solely to help children,
            adults including seniors citizens with eye problems.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          "Besides my mom, I saw so many people who lack the knowledge about eye
          care and needed avenues of getting a comprehensive eye exam by a
          qualified optometrist or an ophthalmologist and I thought on how we
          can get them educated and connected with an eye doctor to get the best
          eye care possible," says Light Amedzekor.
        </p>

        <p>
          With so much enthusiasm, Dr. Light traveled to African countries
          especially Ghana and saw how people were suffering from serious eye
          problems and in some cases blind merely because of the lack of
          financial support to get an eye exam. This was where Dr. Light
          realized that with his help he can be the light at the end of the
          tunnel for those suffering from eye care.
