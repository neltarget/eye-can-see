            Dr. Light Amedzekor, born and raised in the United States of
            America, founded Sight Givers in 2015 while still completing his
            education to become an eye doctor due to the fact that his mother
            Victoria Amedzekor lost her left eye and suffered from glaucoma eye
            disease in the right eye before passing away. The company was
            providing door to door service at the comfort of patient’s home and
            quickly grew to a storefront in New York and now have several
            clinics in Ghana with the intention of saving blindness in
            impoverished communities.
